		<h1>Our Approach</h1>
		<p class="first">We started our research was by gathering the information necessary to understand and try to estimate the timeframes in which AI will be developing. Firstly, we examined the current state of the development of AI in order to gain a clear understanding of our point of origin. We then looked at the opinions of thought leaders in the field of AI. We proceeded to look at technologies that underpin the development of AI, in an attempt to understand what is necessary for the AI to enter new areas of application, and when is this likely to happen.</p>
		<p>Consequently, possible impacts of these developments of AI on all areas of our life were considered. First of all, we think that the economic impacts of AI will be profound, leading to exponential increases in economic efficiency and welfare spending. This will inevitably lead to profound social processes and may even cause fundamental changes in our society structure - we have examined various ideas of existing authors as to what a post-capitalist society may look like. Implementation of AI in various fields will also inevitably create ethical and legal dilemmas, which we studied and examined potential ways how they can be resolved. Finally, security considerations become increasingly vital as our increasing exposure to AI creates vulnerabilities, so we looked at the possible negative consequences and the ways we can prevent them.</p>

		<h1>The Timeline</h1>
		<p class="first">Based on the research outlined above, and employing our imagination, we have developed a set of scenarios that could happen in the future as a result of AI development, and displayed them on our Timeline. The events described on the timeline are presented as news articles from the future and are intentionally designed to be speculative and seem provocative in order to stimulate the reader’s imagination. Yet, all the creative content is actually heavily grounded in research and existing trends, which are laid out in “The Why” section of each event. After it follows “The Impacts” section, where we attempt to predict how the development in question may impact the future world. </p>
		<p>The question of whether AGI can be achieved, and its potential impacts, is a highly uncertain and debatable question. As it is hard to peek beyond the point of AGI, we decided to use it as our ‘horizon’, and only considered applications of Weak AI within the scope of the timeline. However, our thoughts and research on the questions of viability of AGI and computer consciousness are presented separately in the Singularity section at the end.</p>
