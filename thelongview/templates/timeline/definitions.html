		<h1>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h1>
		<p class="first">So what does the term “AI” actually mean? Marvin Minsky, ‘the father’ of AI research, defined AI as “the science of making machines do things that would require intelligence if done by men”. Then, what is intelligence? This is still a largely debated question, due to the fact that we only understand some mechanisms of intelligence and not the others (McCarthy, 2007). But as Jack Copeland (2000) put it:</p>
		<div class="quote">“Quite simple human behaviour can be intelligent yet quite complex behaviour performed by insects is unintelligent. What is the difference? Consider the behaviour of the digger wasp, Sphex ichneumoneus. When the female wasp brings food to her burrow, she deposits it on the threshold, goes inside the burrow to check for intruders, and then if the coast is clear carries in the food. The unintelligent nature of the wasp's behaviour is revealed if the watching experimenter moves the food a few inches while the wasp is inside the burrow checking. On emerging, the wasp repeats the whole procedure: she carries the food to the threshold once again, goes in to look around, and emerges. She can be made to repeat this cycle of behaviour upwards of forty times in succession. Intelligence - conspicuously absent in the case of Sphex - is the ability to adapt one's behaviour to fit new circumstances.” </div>

		<p>Thus, one should distinguish between different levels of AI:</p>
		<p><span class="emphasis">Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)</span>, also referred to as <span class="emphasis">Weak AI</span>, is AI that specialises in one and only one area. The examples of such systems are self-driving cars, email spam filters, Google Translate, Spotify or Netflix recommendation engines, automated trading on the stock market. ANI is still considered to be an ‘AI’, despite not meeting the intelligence definition presented above.</p>
		<p><span class="emphasis">Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)</span>, also called <span class="emphasis">Strong AI</span>, is usually defined as a computer system that is able to perform any intellectual task as well as humans can. This includes traditional intellectual tasks, such as solving maths problems or logic puzzles, but also an ability to understand language and process visual information, make educated guesses, improvise in novel circumstances, plan and learn, as well as integrating all these towards achieving a certain goal.</p>
		<p><span class="emphasis">Artificial Super-Intelligence (ASI)</span> - as defined by Nick Bostrom: "an intellect that is much smarter than the best human brains in practically every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom and social skills.” However, it is an open and highly debatable question whether an ASI system would possess other human capabilities such as intentionality, sentience and qualia, and thus whether any AI system can ever be conscious in the human sense of the word. </p>
		<p>Research in AI has focussed mainly on the following components of intelligence: learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language-understanding.</p>
